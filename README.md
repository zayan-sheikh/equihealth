# equiHealth
equiHealth is a full-stack MERN application, supported by Spline for the 3D unicorn. It's similar to Duolingo in the sense that the user tries to maintain a daily streak, except instead of language-learning, they must carry out a wellness task. Such tasks include drinking enough water, journaling, or taking a walk. The app documents which category of tasks the user most frequently chooses, then recommends Arc'teryx products for the user based on the user's favourite category.
